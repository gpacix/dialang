    __ cylinder
    __ polygon
    __ parallelogram

 __ replace "click" with URL in rollover text  04/07/24 23:42:45 EDT

 __ add multi-line labels, or wrap them, or both 04/07/24 17:55:23 EDT
 __ add simple things from markdown to text: bold, italic  04/07/24 19:30:32 EDT
 __ add URL links to edges, (maybe can refer to these by ID?)  04/07/24 19:30:26 EDT

 __ make the language case-insensitive  04/07/24 13:13:42 EDT
 __ start dealing with stroke, not just fill  04/07/24 19:00:17 EDT
 __ add rollover effects: start with just changing color (or leave this to CSS?)  04/07/24 21:47:39 EDT
 __ simple automatic layout of shapes  04/07/24 21:44:03 EDT
 __ indicate that some items are contained inside other ones  04/07/24 21:42:41 EDT
 __ describe links with A -- B <- C -> D syntax; maybe support ---, -->, etc. too  04/07/24 21:43:28 EDT
 __ let the user define new shapes, maybe as macros; disallow recursion 04/07/24 18:58:29 EDT
